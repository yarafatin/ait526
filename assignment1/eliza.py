Problem Description:
Eliza is a program that simulates conversation with a human user using simple pattern matching and transformation rules.
The goal of Eliza was not to provide intelligent or deep understanding of human language, but rather to mimic
a psychotherapist. The focus is on active listening and reflection, allowing the client to explore their thoughts and
feelings. Eliza emulates this approach by posing questions and making statements that encourage the user to elaborate
on their concerns.  

Setup and usage Instructions:
1. Install Python 3.9.0
2. Install nltk 
2. Run the program using python3 eliza.py
3. Enter the text you wish to chat with Eliza, the psychotherapist
4. Enter 'quit' if you wish to discontinue

Example program input and output:
eliza>> Hello there, My name is Eliza, your psychotherapist. What is your name?
user>> Robert
eliza>> Hello Robert, How are you feeling today?
Robert>>  I am feeling sad
eliza>> Why are you feeling sad?
Robert>>  I had a panic attack yesterday
eliza>> Tell me more about the panic attack yesterday.
Robert>>  I don't like crowded places
eliza>> Why don't you like crowded places?
Robert>>  I feel happy when I'm with my friends
eliza>> What is contributing to your feelings of happy when you are with your friends?
Robert>>  I am constantly worried about the future
eliza>> Why are you constantly worried about the future?
Robert>>  I had a nightmare last night
eliza>> Tell me more about the nightmare last night.
Robert>>  I don't enjoy socializing
eliza>> Tell me more
Robert>>  I feel lonely most of the time
eliza>> What is contributing to your feelings of lonely most of the time?
Robert>>  I am experiencing a lot of stress at work
eliza>> Why are you experiencing a lot of stress at work?
Robert>>  I get angry easily
eliza>> What situations typically trigger your anger?
Robert>>  I feel exhausted all the time
eliza>> What is contributing to your feelings of exhausted all the time?
Robert>>  I had a disagreement with my partner
eliza>> Tell me more about the disagreement with your partner.
Robert>>  I feel lost and confused about my life
eliza>> What is contributing to your feelings of lost and confused about your life?
Robert>>  I struggle with low self-esteem
eliza>> What are some factors that contribute to your feelings of low self-esteem?
Robert>>  I am addicted to smoking
eliza>> Why are you addicted to smoking?
Robert>>  quit
It was a pleasure talking to you

Bonus Functionality:
1) Validate name of user in the first response and if it is invalid, prompt again for a valid name.
2) If the user inputs text that is not in the response dictionary for three consecutive times, the program will
   provide a response that it couldn't understand the user and will refer to a senior psychotherapist.

Algorithm:
This code utilizes a rule-based algorithm using regular expressions, where predefined answers are determined based 
on the user's input. The program is implemented as below:
1) Print an introduction message and ask the user for their name.
2) Validate and extract the first name from the user's response.
3) Check if the user entered the quit command. If so, terminate the conversation.
4) Set a flag is_first_question to True to track if it is the first question.
5) Initialize an empty list called last_questions to store the last three questions asked.
6) Enter a while loop until the quit command is entered.
7) Check if the user's response is blank. If so, prompt the user to provide a response and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
8) Check if the user's name is empty or contains no alphabetic characters. 
If so, prompt the user to provide a valid name and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
9) If it is the first question, ask the patient how they are feeling today. Set is_first_question to False.
10) If it is not the first question, generate a new question using the generate_question_to_user function based on the 
patient's response. Append the new question to last_questions.
11) Check if last_questions contains three questions. If so, remove the oldest question from the list.
12) Prompt the patient for their response to the generated question.
13) Check if last_questions contains three questions and all of them are "Tell me more". If so, print a fallback message and break out of the loop.
14) Check if the patient's response matches the quit command. If so, break out of the loop.
15) Continue the loop by generating a new question based on the patient's response.
16) Repeat steps 7-15 until the quit command is entered.
17) Print a closing message: "It was a pleasure talking to you."
